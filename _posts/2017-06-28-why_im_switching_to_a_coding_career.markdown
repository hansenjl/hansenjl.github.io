Throughout my life I've had many encounters with simple coding programs like NetLogo, EasyC, and BASIC. In every experience I found the challenge intriguing and exciting. I have loved the logic and the intuitiveness of the coding languages that have been introdued to me. Trying to find errors in the code always seemed like an intresting puzzle to solve. I knew that I enjoyed coding, but I had never thought about the possibilities of it being my career. 

As a high school engineering teacher, I had the opportunity to learn how to program robots in order to teach my students to do the same. During that unit, I would also introduce my students to related careers they could pursue. Meanwhile, I would be thinking, "These careers are so cool! I wish I could start over and choose one of them."  I still really didn't see it as a viable option until two of my colleagues decided to put teaching on hold and learn how to code at a coding bootcamp. After hearing about their successful experiences, I decided it was time to branch out and give it a try. 

I am very excited to learn new skills and try out a different realm of the job market.
